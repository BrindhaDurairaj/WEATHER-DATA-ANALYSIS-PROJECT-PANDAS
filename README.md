# WEATHER-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT-PANDAS
Weather data analysis using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook. Explored unique wind speeds, counted clear weather and wind speed = 4 kmph, removed nulls, identified snow and fog conditions, and filtered data where wind > 24 &amp; visibility = 25, or where humidity > 50 with clear skies.
